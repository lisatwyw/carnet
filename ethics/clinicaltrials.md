This Organization already has an account, but since there is no central PRS Administrator, would you like us to create an individual account under this Organization’s name? User accounts are created to allow PIs to register their trials when no central organizational Administrator exists.

ClinicalTrials.gov establishes one PRS account for each organization (such as a company, university, or medical center). All investigators from that organization who are conducting studies are typically designated as users of this single PRS account. The organization should designate one or more PRS Administrators to manage the account. Administrators have three primary responsibilities:

1.    Maintain their organization's PRS account (including creating and modifying user accounts, designating other users as Administrators, creating and managing Groups, and monitoring for problems with records)
2.    Approve and release study records and updates when the Sponsor is the Responsible Party
3.    Serve as the primary point of contact with the ClinicalTrials.gov team

Administrators can create and modify user accounts, designate other users as Administrators, create and manage Groups, and manage the organization's account.

Each entity submitting data to ClinicalTrials.gov must adhere to ClinicalTrials.gov terms and conditions, which are intended to ensure the accuracy, currency and validity of data. Please see the following before applying for an account or entering data:
