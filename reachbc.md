# Findings from REACH BC's demo on 2021-Jan-22

- They are strictly for BC participants 
   - e.g. we may not use their platform for recruiting out-of-province participants
   - they suggested https://bethecure.ca/ if recruiting from Alberta 
   
- Clicking "Join" on REACH BC without an active volunteer account is not streamlined (will not redirect to the study link)

- Making edits on the REACH BC form will inactivate the study until REACH BC staff approves the edits 
  - So perhaps refrain from doing this or email their staff for immediate approval?
  
- If the study becomes inactive, volunteers will no longer be able to signup 
  - So perhaps do not attempt to troubleshoot REACH BC system by editing the form when volunteer is trying to sign up
  
- The health categories listed by the interested volunteer must align with those listed for the study; otherwise, the study will not show up on the new volunteer's dashboard
