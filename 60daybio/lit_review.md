Monitoring Schedule
A common recommendation is that self-measured BP monitoring be based on 2 measurements taken at least 1 minute apart in the morning and evening
(ie, 4 readings per day) optimally for 7 days (ie, 28 readings total) with a minimum of 3 days (ie, 12 readings total).17,26,40,41 
For each monitoring period, the average of all SBP and DBP readings should be obtained to assess BP, and the “eyeball method” (ie, visually scanning 
the readings to determine the presence of high BP or BP control) should be avoided. Some guidelines and scientific statements recommend excluding the
first day’s readings.40 If the first day’s readings are excluded, the preferred and minimum periods of monitoring should be 8 and 4 days, respectively.
Several guidelines and scientific statements also recommend that monitoring be conducted over consecutive days.26,40 However, readings taken on 
nonconsecutive days may also provide valid data. Once BP control is achieved and BP remains stable for several months, monitoring 1 to 3 days every week
is probably sufficient.34

### Mobile Health Intervention to Close the Guidelines-To-Practice Gap in Hypertension Treatment: Protocol for the mGlide Randomized Controlled Trial

Research Protocol 2021
```
Methods:
We are recruiting 450 participants including stroke survivors and primary care patients with elevated cardiovascular disease risk from diverse health systems. 
These systems include an acute stroke service (n=100), an academic medical center (n=150), and community medical centers including Federally Qualified Health
Centers serving low-income and minority (Latino, Hmong, African American, Somali) patients (n=200). The primary aim tests the clinical effectiveness of the
6-month mHealth intervention versus standard of care. Secondary aims evaluate sustained hypertension control rates at 12 months; describe provider experiences
of system usability and satisfaction; examine patient experiences, including medication adherence and medication use self-efficacy, self-rated health and 
quality of life, and adverse event rates; and complete a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Results:
To date, we have randomized 107 participants (54 intervention, 53 control)....
