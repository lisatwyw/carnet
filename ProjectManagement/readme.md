# Project Management 

## Part 1

- Success: Achieves our goals on time and within budget 

- What's a project?
  - Unique in some ways 
  - Progressive elaboration
  - Temporary start and end
    - Has standard life cycle
    - Initiation & finalization 

- Keeping on track

## Part 2

- Deliverables
  - Forward-thinking statement
- Smart goal's approach:
  - Specific, measurable, agreed upon, recorded, time-framed
   
- Assumptions (e.g. resources, budget) need to be tracked
  - Outcomes of previous activities


## Part 3

### Stakeholders: those fit in one or more classes:
- active involved
- exert influence
- project will be impacted
- interested in execution or project outcomes [outside]

### Requirements (vs. expectations)

- identifiable, objective, measurable
- expectations: keeping stakeholders informed so they do not feel unexpected

### Risk assessement 

- Brainstorming: ask each team Q
- SWOT (more structured):
  - strengths
  - weaknesses
  - opportunities 
  - threats
- interviewing
- Rank and prioritization  

Q: How each stakeholder will be impacted for each risk?

- Funding
- Personnel
- Competition


### Quality
- Measurable metrics: # of certified trainees
- Grade: subjective

### Project cost management

### Project execution 

Metrics:
- efficiency 
- quality
- 18 registrations vs 2 attendees

- Completion metrics/ closing
- stakeholders have everything needed


### Project management
- ongoing basis

# Budget cost management
- what and how to conduct project within budget?
- resources
- project activities
- consider inflation, albeit some funders do not allow
 
## Techniques
- Ballpark: " Rough order of magnitude", e.g. half hour estimate <-- least accurate
- Analogous/ top-down
- Parametric modeling - per unit
- Bottom-up: est cost of each element

## Categories
- admin
- equiment
- salaries / benefits (S&B)
- consumables: supplies / materials
  - e.g. disposable lab supplies
- services

### Non-trivial items 

e.g. plane fare/ accommodation
- need to understand purposes: 
  - required by funders --> administrative
  - one shop (travel agent) to book hotel+plane+transfers --> services
  - knowledge translation by co-Is --> consumables
  - staff? --> S&B

e.g. mileage/ meal costs for team members to visit sites for sample collection
- needed for conduct of project --> consumables
- vs. staff wanting to do it (S&B)

## S&B

- FTE = full-time equivalent, full year
- allow for inflation
- underestimate: 20% avg to start, use gross salary
- for every 5-7 FTE, add 0.2FTE to allow for leave, turnover

# Budget justification

- 3C's: clear, concise, complete
- consider explaining what is not in the budget

## Crashing the budget
- non-critical path vs critical path activites/ elements

### Budget management principles
- accountable
- reportable
- 

### Monitoring
- Contingency funds: where spent
- Limit expense authorization

### Reporting
- Quarterly

### Funding sources & considerations

- business/private sector: IP management, project leadership/control
- government granting agencies timeliness, responsiveness, success rate/ demand

#### Donor's gift
- considerations: 
  - will institution charge overhead?
  - what does institution need?
- project time period
- eligible & ineligible expenses
- matching funding opportunities

Aside: may need to recruit team member to faciliate knowledge translation (to communicate to donors how gift led to impactful research outcomes without needing their expertise)
  
  
#### Matching funds
- Cash vs in-kind
- in-kind: value of good/ ervice
- co-funding: separate reporting to individual donors


## Project execution 

- Leader
- Devil's advocate
- Dreamer
