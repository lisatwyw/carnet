# Project Management 

## Part 1

- Success: Achieves our goals on time and within budget 

- What's a project?
  - Unique in some ways 
  - Progressive elaboration
  - Temporary start and end
    - Has standard life cycle
    - Initiation & finalization 

- Keeping on track

## Part 2

- Deliverables
  - Forward-thinking statement
- Smart goal's approach:
  - Specific, measurable, agreed upon, recorded, time-framed
   
- Assumptions (e.g. resources, budget) need to be tracked
  - Outcomes of previous activities


## Part 3

### Stakeholders: those fit in one or more classes:
- active involved
- exert influence
- project will be impacted
- interested in execution or project outcomes [outside]

### Requirements (vs. expectations)

- identifiable, objective, measurable
- expectations: keeping stakeholders informed so they do not feel unexpected
