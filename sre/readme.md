- Suggestions:

    1. Log-off vs. disconnect
        - Try to log-off instead of disconnect your session because you may not likely be able to reconnect after some period of time
        - If you left script A opened in a disconnected session and try to edit the same script in a new session, you cannot save the changes unless you create a new file (will have to resort to ```Save As```)
