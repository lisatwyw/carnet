## Suggestions:

### Log-off vs. disconnect  
- Try to log-off instead of disconnect your session because you may not likely be able to reconnect after some period of time
- If you left script A opened in a disconnected session and try to edit the same script in a new session, you cannot save the changes unless you create a new file (will have to resort to ```Save As```)

## Running Python code

1. [Wings Personal 2019](Wings.md)

2. Run Python 3.9 directly in Command prompt  <-- **Preferred over next option**

3. Python in IDLE (dont recommend it)

- Turn-off Auto-completion; a pain otherwise (to wait for suggestions to come up)!!!
  - Options menu (northeast corner), untic ```Enable Auto-completion```
  - Untic other options too, unless you find them helpful
