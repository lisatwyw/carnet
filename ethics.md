## Preparing ethics

General notes:
1. Project title must match the funding account exactly
2. Place project title (not project nickname) on the footer, along with ethics number, date of version, and optionally version number (self-assigned)

### Study details

TBC

### Recruitment

1. REACH BC: 
  - consult the standard operating procedures of REACHBC on interacting with REACHBC volunteers; include them into ethics application
  - try out the volunteer's account to understand the interface and explore ways to overcome bottlenecks 
  - set up researchers account; create a study flyer by filling out details
  - submit for approval

2. Email invitations 
  - invitation draft should be added to ethics; include ethics number on the invitations

3. Printed posters

  - Consider putting UBC logo on the poster
  - Consider audience, norms at the posting sites; e.g.
    i. At clinic, email Dianne for advice early on
    ii. At ED
      - One will need to laminate posters if they need to be kept for more than 30 days 
      - Best practice is to consult nurse educators at ED; e.g. Julie and Lara 
  - Answer pending: could we place posters that are larger than letter size at ED?

## Submitting ethics

- After clicking submit, would require PI to submit as form of authorization.
- Expect review to take place within same week or the next
- Provisos will be requested to address reviewer(s)' concerns in any section
